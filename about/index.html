   <h1>Hello, I'm Benjamin Hamlin</h1>
   <h2>Education</h2>
   <p>I graduated Fife High School in 2009 where soon after I attended Bates Technical College. At Bates I studied Database Technology with a focus on Oracle databases.</p>
   <p>After graduating from Bates, I attended Tacoma Community College to obtain a degree that would transfer to a university. I studied Java programming in TCC's Computer Science program while I finished up the majority of the general education requirements.</p>
   <p>I graduated from Washington State University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in May 2019. At WSU, I focussed on programming in C and C++ even going as far as being a teaching assistant leading a lab teaching C to students in CS 121.</p>
