   <h1>Hello, I'm Benjamin Hamlin</h1>
   <h2>Education</h2>
   <p>I graduated Fife High School in 2009 where soon after I attended Bates Technical College.
      At Bates I studied Database Technology with a focus on Oracle databases.</p>
   <p>After graduating from Bates, I attended Tacoma Community College to obtain a degree that would transfer to a university.
      I studied Java programming in TCC's Computer Science program while I finished up the majority of the general education requirements.</p>
   <p>I graduated from Washington State University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in May 2019.
      At WSU, I focussed on programming in C and C++ even going as far as being a teaching assistant leading a lab teaching C to students in CS 121.</p>
   <h2>Work</h2>
   <p>While attending WSU, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for Andrew O'Fallon for two semesters.
      As a TA, I lead a three hour lab where the students would put into practice what they had learned the week prior.
      Often, a summary of concepts would be given during the first half hour.</p>
   <p>During my junior year, I was a Residential Technology Assistant (RTA) for Stephenson East Residence Hall.
      For one semester my TA position overlapped with my RTA job. As an RTA, I was a liason between ITS at WSU and the students of the hall I was assigned.
      This meant that I submitted tickets for problems with the network in the hall and solved minor problems students were experiencing.
      I worked with students of the hall to solve printing problems and answer any technology related questions.</p>
