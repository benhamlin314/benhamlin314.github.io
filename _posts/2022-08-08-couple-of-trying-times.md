### Life Update
It has been two years since my last blog post. A lot has happened over the last two years. Where do I even begin? Life has had its ups and downs. I got engaged to the love of my life, Nicole. Medical issues tended to be the common scenario throughout the last couple years. I have been separated from my position at Pierce County due to my inability to work over a year because of my medical issues. It was issue after issue. I am amazed that I have managed to continue studying and growing during all that tribulation. <!--more-->

### WTF Medical issues
In March of 2021, I had my mental health hit a crazy low point. I found myself in a state of constant panic for 5 days. By 3pm every day, I was so exhausted I could barely move. I was finally able to get in to see my doctor and start the process to recover my mental health. Today, I can happily say that my mental health is in a great state. I don't know what triggered that sudden and deep drop in my mental health. I suspect that Covid had a role to play as well as impostor syndrome. While I was not diagnosed with impostor syndrome I do relate to the consistent feeling that I am unprepared or underqualified for my position or the positions I am an applicant for.
Once the mental health was under control, I returned to work for a short period only to have a sudden onset of hypersensitivity and numbness throughout the left side of my body. It got to a point where it often felt like razor blades on my skin any time I touched or felt anything. Typing on a keyboard proved to be torturous forcing me to go back on medical leave. After a year, I was separated from Pierce County due to being on medical leave for a year.

### Marriage
On April 23rd 2022, I had the best day of my life. A lot of people say that their wedding day was the best day of their life but, it literally was the best day of my life. I was so happy and energetic. With my health to a point where I can move and do a lot of activity only to take a week to recover afterwards, I hit the dance floor like I had never done before! Nicole and I laughed and reveled in the start of our life. We spent the next few nights at an Air BnB just to relax in our life together.
