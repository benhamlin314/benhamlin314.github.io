### Employment Never Felt so Good
After sending out hundreds of applications, I have accepted an offer to be a Software Engineer 1 with Pierce County IT. I am excited to start my career tomorrow. The first steps into a life where I can finally live rather than surviving. I am eager to learn and grow every day. The first few weeks will most likely be a lot of meetings and learning everything needed in order to fulfill my role. Also, learning everything that my role entails. I hope that I can bring a lot of knowledge and energy to the team I will be assigned to.

### Studying Just to Study
Now that I have a job, I am able to study anything I want in my free time. I have been studying computer science to prepare for coding interviews for so long that I am finally able to study game design and design patterns. It has been a great relief. I'll be able to focus on some personal growth through studying my own interests as well. I've been hoping to study photography and 3D modelling more and finally I have some time to do so. I think it is important to pursue your passions and hobbies. Your own interests and hobbies give you the escape from the monotony of daily life.
