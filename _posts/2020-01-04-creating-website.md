I decided to create an online portfolio and blog to showcase what I have been working on as well as what I am doing.

## Since Graduating
I have continued studying Python 3 creating projects such as [mynotepad](https://github.com/benhamlin314/mynotepad), [mymoviefinder](https://github.com/benhamlin314/mymoviefinder), and working on problems from Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle McDowell in C, C++, Python 3, C#, and Java uploaded to [benhamlin314/CrackingCoding](https://github.com/benhamlin314/CrackingCoding)

Graduating was a huge accomplishment for me since my *brain decompression surgery* in the summer of 2018. Not only did I return to school the following fall after the surgery, but I graduated as a member of the Delta Alpha Pi Honor Society. The major downside to having the surgery was missing out on an opportunity to do an internship. Not having an internship has led to some difficulty in starting my career but I continue to study and expand my knowledge while I apply for positions I consider myself well suited for. I am not discouraged by the selection of other candidates for positions that I applied for because I understand that the best candidate needs to be selected and a candidate with an internship holds understanding of the industry that I can only assume. The right job for me will come soon enough and the door to my career will open.
