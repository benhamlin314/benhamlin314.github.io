Senior year at WSU has been rough because of my brain decompression surgery. My neck is often sore leading to headaches. Thankfully, I am able to have flexible attendance in most of my classes. I have been able to keep up with my studies but large projects have been difficult to get done before their deadlines.

Thanks to wonderful friends, I have been able to keep my spirits up even though I am often in pain. It is my last year of school. I will graduate in May if I just keep going and focus on studying.
