### The Never Ending Year
2020 began with everyone saying that it would be their year. Everyone didn't like how 2019 ended up for them and wanted to do better for themselves and those around them. Individuals making decisions to be intentional in everything they do to ensure a better outcome. Covid 19 stopped the good intentions in its tracks. Covid 19 brought about a year of pain and suffering that would not end. Covid 19 broke many individuals that sought to better themselves.<!--more--> Instead, those individuals feel defeat like no other. The year of 2020 has felt as if it has been a decade of life thrown into a single year. All the pain and toil one would feel has been so casually catapulted straight to our face. At the start of the year, I was beginning the career search once again. I took a hiatus for a few months to build up a portfolio of projects. On the 6th of January, I wrote "I have a good feeling about this year! I am excited about the opportunities knocking at my door. We will see where this all goes," as though it could only get better. Don't get me wrong. My family, friends, girlfriend and I are all healthy and doing well. There is much to live for and love, but there has been a lot that was lost as well. Today there are more than 250000 Americans that have died due to Covid 19. A quarter of a million people from a single country. A quarter of a million people from a country where citizens shout and exclaim that it is the greatest country on Earth but so arrogant to let so many die. I am ashamed of the people in the United States of America. The selfishness and lack of empathy has reached a breadth and depth that I couldn't fathom.
