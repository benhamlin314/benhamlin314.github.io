### My First Final Interview
Today I had my first final interview for a Software Engineer position. It consisted of 17 questions dealing with mostly coding concepts and development concepts. There were also some behavioral questions as well. It seemed to go well. It was stressful leading up to the interview. Anxiety is horrible and has been such a major hurdle to get over with anything new that I do. Once I get over that hurdle, I feel accomplished and almost a sense of empowerment can overcome me. Likely the empowerment feeling is due to the adrenaline pumping through my veins though.

### What do I do now?
The only interview I currently had lined up has come and gone. I find myself pondering whether or not to continue to submit applications to other career opportunities or wait until after this following week when I will be notified on the status of my application for the position I just had the final interview. Either way I will continue to study in my free time learning JavaScript and refreshing my knowledge of Java. I will probably never stop studying Computer Science concepts and different programming languages. I have always had a drive to study and seek knew knowledge on topics of interest.

### Future Goals
I plan on starting my own independent game developer company as a passion project at some point. I have some game ideas that I have discussed in length with some friends and it seems like the games would be well received by a diverse user base. Beyond having people play my games, I just want to create games for fun for people to enjoy. Games that leave you thinking about life's big questions or taking a closer look at yourself. Those are the kinds of games I would like to create. Until I am ready, I will continue to practice 3D modelling and study game design patterns.
