"What the heck is going on?" This was the thought that went through my head as I began to lose feeling in my left side. It felt like I was having a stroke. Numbness and tingling throughout the left side of my body resulting in difficulty walking and talking. It all started in December of 2017 while I was studying for my finals in the Fall of my Junior year. Fast forward a little to being diagnosed with a **Type 1 Chiari Malformation**.

### Type 1 Chiari Malformation
So what is a **Type 1 Chiari Malformation**. Well, it is a congenital defect resulting in the brain being to large for the skull causing it to be pushed into the spinal column. My brain was being pushed far enough to apply pressure to my spinal cord resulting in the numbness I was feeling. To remedy the situation it called for surgery where the surgeon would remove a section of my skull at its base and C1 vertebra to give my brain the room it needed. The surgery will take place later this summer. I have complete confidence in the doctors and nurses.
