### Many Applications Later
Over the last 7 months I have applied to numerous career opportunities ranging from internships for recent graduates to Junior Software Developer positions. I do not have much industry experience and have limited myself to applying to positions in that range to gain the necessary experience. I am excited to start my career. Interviews have been quite scarce since graduating. I assumed it was my lack of experience and began making projects and studying until I had a portfolio that would catch someone's eye.

### First Hurdle Complete
I got my first second interview since the beginning of my job hunt. It seems so weird to feel accomplished for something that is so minor but it has been difficult getting to this point. I am nervous about the interview to say the least. I have been studying JavaScript in all of my free time to help prepare me for the interview. The phone interview consisted of question about web development and web applications I have developed. I haven't done much of either in all reality but I have wanted to learn web development.

### Learning as I go
Jekyll has been an interesting tool allowing you create webpages by compiling Markdown files. This blog you are reading right now is written in Markdown. Kramdown to be exact. I don't know what the future of this portfolio/blog has in store for it. I plan on making a larger website in the future where hamlan.net will be a gaming clan website where my friends and I can connect and socialize. I'd also have information about game servers located on that future site. That is likely a year or more down the road though.

### Cheers to a good year
I have a good feeling about this year! I am excited about the opportunities knocking at my door. We will see where this all goes.

#### Thanks for reading
